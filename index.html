											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hi all! My name is Rohan Batra and I am a rising senior at Georgia Institute of Technology pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. 
											I am a highly inquisitive individual with a zeal to make a difference in the world of computer science. 
											With a strong fascination for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science, alongside a passion for crafting web applications, I am excited to further develop my skills in this digital world.
											I like to lead and innovate in the endeavors that I take up, whether it be in academics, projects, or sports (specifically soccer!). 
											Ideating and critical thinking are the strong suits that help me think out of the box and achieve top honors consistently. While I do have distinct leadership traits, I am a team player and collaborate wholeheartedly according to the need of the situation. 
											Causes of environment and community health, resonate with my faculty of empathy and compassion.

							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>Hi all! My name is Rohan Batra and I am a tech enthusiast eager to solve complex problems using smart and innovative solutions. I was born in Virginia, USA, and raised in New Delhi, India. Apart from coding to develop games and applications and provide users with simple solutions, some of my hobbies include playing sports like soccer and basketball and strumming the guitar. I was the captain of the high school soccer team of Lotus Valley International School, Noida, and part of the senior student council. Traveling with friends and family and surfing online for the latest shoes are two activities I have always been elated by.</p>
